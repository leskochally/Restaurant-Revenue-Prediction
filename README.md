# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction
New restaurant sites take large investments of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred.  Finding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI(Company name) to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for new employees. Using demographic, real estate, and commercial data, I made a model to predict the annual restaurant sales of 100,000 regional locations.  Used RandomForest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Linear Regression. DecisionTree Regressor and tried to come up with the best model
